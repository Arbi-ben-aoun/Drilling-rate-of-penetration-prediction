#  Geothermal drilling R.O.P using machine learning and deep learning

The drilling dataset used is from Utah FORGE named Well 58-32 (previously labeled MU-ESW1), which was drilled near Milford Utah, to confirm geothermal reservoir characteristics 

Data was preprocessed for machine learning and deep learning predictions using :

-Random forest regreesion
-Support Vector machine regression
-Artificial neural network
